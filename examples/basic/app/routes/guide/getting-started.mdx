# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Ardo Basic Example**. This is a minimal documentation site that demonstrates Ardo as a pure static site generator — no TypeDoc, no library code, just Markdown.

## What's Included

This example shows:

- Markdown content with frontmatter
- Automatic route generation
- Built-in search
- Dark mode support
- Static pre-rendering

## Project Structure

```

│   ├── root.tsx
│   ├── entry.client.tsx
│   └── entry.server.tsx
├── vite.config.ts
├── react-router.config.ts
└── package.json
```

## Running Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

The output will be in `build/client/`, ready for static hosting on Vercel, Netlify, or any other platform.
