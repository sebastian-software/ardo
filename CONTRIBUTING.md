### Architecture

The architecture decision records in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/) explain the major framework
decisions: React Router migration, static prerendering, TypeDoc integration, Vanilla Extract,
context-aware UI, public API naming, Storybook, Tailwind in the scaffold, and release conventions.
Read them before changing routing, public exports, theming, build output, or release behavior.

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

| Command           | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `pnpm build`      | Build all packages             |
| `pnpm dev`        | Start ardo package in dev mode |
| `pnpm docs:dev`   | Start documentation dev server |
| `pnpm test`       | Run tests                      |
| `pnpm test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode        |
| `pnpm lint`       | Run ESLint                     |
| `pnpm format`     | Format code with Prettier      |
| `pnpm typecheck`  | Run TypeScript type checking   |

### Performance Budgets

The docs site build is guarded by performance budgets (`pnpm docs:budgets`, runs in CI). The check builds the docs site and fails on material regressions in:

- **`entry.client` gzip size** — the main client entry served to every visitor
- **Total client JS gzip size** — all JavaScript in `docs/build/client`
- **Search index gzip size** — the serialized `virtual:ardo/search-index` payload
- **Docs build duration** — a generous cap that only catches pathological slowdowns

Budget values and measured baselines live at the top of [`scripts/check-budgets.mjs`](./scripts/check-budgets.mjs). If your change intentionally exceeds a budget, update the budget and baseline there and explain the increase in the commit message. To re-check sizes without rebuilding, run `node scripts/check-budgets.mjs --no-build`.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feat/feature-name` — New features
- `fix/bug-description` — Bug fixes
- `docs/what-changed` — Documentation changes
- `refactor/what-changed` — Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. This enables automatic changelog generation.

**Format:**

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat` — New feature
- `fix` — Bug fix
- `docs` — Documentation changes
- `style` — Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor` — Code refactoring
- `perf` — Performance improvements
- `test` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore` — Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat: add support for custom containers
fix: correct dark mode toggle behavior
docs: update getting started guide
```

### Code Style

- We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- TypeScript is required for all source code
- Run `pnpm format` before committing

Git hooks (via Husky) will automatically:

- Format staged files on commit
- Run type checking on push

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above
3. **Add tests** if applicable
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Run the full test suite** with `pnpm test`
6. **Ensure type checking passes** with `pnpm typecheck`
7. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description
