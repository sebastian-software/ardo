# What is Ardo?

Ardo is a **React-first Static Documentation Framework** built on [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) and inspired by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).

- **File-based routing** - Automatic route generation
- **Server functions** - Efficient data loading
- **Static site generation** - Pre-rendered pages for fast loading
- **Full-stack capabilities** - When you need them

### Vite-Powered

Built on Vite, Ardo offers:

- ⚡ Instant dev server startup
- 🔥 Lightning-fast HMR
- 📦 Optimized production builds
- 🧩 Rich plugin ecosystem

## Features

### Markdown + React

<CustomComponent prop="value" />
