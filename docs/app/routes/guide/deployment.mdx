# Deployment

Ardo produces a fully static site out of the box. When you run `pnpm build`, React Router prerenders every page to static HTML (via `prerender: true` in your `react-router.config.ts`), so no server is needed at runtime.

The build output is located in `build/client/` and can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

## GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Configure Base Path and Basename

Ardo automatically detects your GitHub repository name from the git remote and sets Vite's `base` path for you. No manual `base` configuration is needed in `vite.config.ts`.

For client-side routing to work correctly under the subdirectory (e.g. `https://username.github.io/my-docs/`), add `basename` to your `react-router.config.ts`:

```ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config"
import { detectGitHubBasename } from "ardo/vite"

export default {
  ssr: false,
  prerender: true,
  basename: detectGitHubBasename(),
} satisfies Config
```

`detectGitHubBasename()` returns `"/repo-name/"` when a GitHub remote is detected, or `undefined` otherwise — so it's safe to leave in place for all environments.

:::tip
The build output is automatically flattened by Ardo. When `basename` creates nested directories like `build/client/repo-name/`, the plugin moves files back to `build/client/` so GitHub Pages serves them correctly. No post-build script is needed.
:::

If you deploy to the root (`https://username.github.io/`), no configuration is needed — both `base` and `basename` will remain at their defaults.

### Step 2: Add a GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "22"
          cache: "pnpm"

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: build/client

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

In your repository settings, go to **Pages** and set the source to **GitHub Actions**.

Push to `main` and the workflow will build and deploy your site automatically.

:::tip
Projects scaffolded with `pnpm create ardo@latest` include this workflow out of the box.
:::

## Netlify

Netlify requires no workflow file. Connect your Git repository in the Netlify dashboard and configure:

- **Build command:** `pnpm build`
- **Publish directory:** `build/client`

Netlify automatically detects the Node.js version from your `package.json` engines field or an `.nvmrc` file.

For subdirectory deployments, set `base` in `vite.config.ts` as described above.

## Vercel

Connect your Git repository in the Vercel dashboard and configure:

- **Build command:** `pnpm build`
- **Output directory:** `build/client`
- **Framework preset:** Other

Vercel handles routing and CDN configuration automatically.

## Other Providers

Since Ardo outputs plain static files to `build/client/`, it works with any static hosting provider (Cloudflare Pages, AWS S3 + CloudFront, Firebase Hosting, etc.). Use `pnpm build` as the build command and `build/client` as the output directory.
